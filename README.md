# Employee Management System

An Employee Management System (EMS) web application built using React.js for the frontend and potentially a backend API for handling employee data.

The project aims to demonstrate a basic Employee Management System with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for employees and includes some authentication-related functionality for login and registration. 

The actual functionality for adding, editing, deleting employees, and handling authentication should be implemented on the server-side in a real-world scenario.
